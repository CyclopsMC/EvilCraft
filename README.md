### Contributing
* Before submitting a pull request containing a new feature, please discuss this first with one of the lead developers.
* When fixing an accepted bug, make sure to declare this in the issue so that no duplicate fixes exist.
* All code must comply to our coding conventions, be clean and must be well documented.
* Information on how to build this mod locally and how to set up your development environment can be found at the [wiki](https://github.com/CyclopsMC/EvilCraft/wiki/Development-Environment).

### Issues
* All bug reports and other issues are appreciated. If the issue is a crash, please include the FULL Forge log.
* Before submission, first check for duplicates, including already closed issues since those can then be re-opened.

### Branching Strategy

For every major Minecraft version, two branches exist:

* `master-{mc_version}`: Latest (potentially unstable) development.
* `release-{mc_version}`: Latest stable release for that Minecraft version. This is also tagged with all mod releases.
